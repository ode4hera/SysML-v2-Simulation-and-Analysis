# Simulation and Analysis Library

This library adds concepts for modeling simulation problems in SysML v2, in particular:
- Time-domain simulation, for example using the [Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)](https://fmi-standard.org/);
  the FMU model description schema is the separate `'FMIv2.0.5'` package (`FMI.sysml`), re-exported by `ModelBasedDesign`
- Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) problems, where many analysis tools coming from different engineering disciplines are integrated in a coupled computational problem, which is typical in a systems engineering context

This library has originally been developed as part of the [ODE4HERA project](https://www.ode4hera.eu/),
however we encourage contributions by anyone!

## Example

Refer to the models in the `examples` folder to see how the library can be used.
